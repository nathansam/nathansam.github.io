I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Health Data Science at the
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) interested in modelling
longitudinal biomarker trajectories and disease outcomes for inflammatory bowel
disease. I am in the [Lees group](https://charlielees.com) and 
[Vallejos group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io)
within the
[Institute of Genetics and Cancer](https://institute-genetics-cancer.ed.ac.uk/)

My research interests include longitudinal modelling, survival analysis,
electronic health records, and machine learning.

I am also an R package developer. My packages can be found on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/nathansam).

In my personal life, I enjoy swimming, the gym, playing bass guitar, and all
things technology.
